Citizenship In The Living City

Motivations:

Decentraland provides a level playing field for individuals and groups to claim their land and build whatever they want. While this free market ideal is very exciting, in general this will result in uneven experiences as parcels owned by different owners will be developed with different ideas, visual styles and goals in mind.

Basic Idea with quasi-centralized governance:

The Living City Project envisions an alternative path where those who wish to become part of something larger than their personal efforts may pledge the use of their land to the city, which will take control of development as part of the larger Living City Roadmap & Timeline. Pledging land owners retain 100% ownership (they may sell to another at any time) and revenue generated within the property is split 50/50 between The Living City and the land owner.

A Living City Planning Committee (LCPC) are elected by some yet undefined mechanism and are tasked with the developing/maintaining the short and long term timeline and roadmap which lays out goals and the business model of the city.

Participants & Access Levels

0 - Anybody
A new user starts with level 0 access - Only publicly accessible areas are available. This is basically a "customer" of the city.

1 - A Land Developer or a Vouchee

Developers
To gain access to undeveloped opportunities, under construction city projects or otherwise non-public but not really private areas and facilities of The Living City, a prospective developer may place a deposit in MANA or demonstrate proficiency with development they've accomplished on non-city land.

Guests
A normal guest may gain access to areas like residential complexes by having a level 2 or higher "vouch" for them. There are two kinds of "Vouching", one which grants access to just the personal propertys of the Citizen. A more advanced "Vouch" is possible, giving the Vouchee (guest) basically Citizen level access, but which makes the Citizen responsible and potentially liable for any damage they cause with that access.

2 - A Citizen
Anybody can become a citizen by contributing to the Living City Project within Decentraland. Users can pledge MANA or specific city-adjacent plots of land at a rate set by the LCPC to become citizens and so long as the pledge remains, the user retains citizenship status.

A Developer can earn citizenship by working into it, pledging MANA Or Land earned through LCPC approved development towards the status.

Citizens are given access to private communication channels, development/investment opportunities and empowered to vote for makeup of the LCPC

3 - A Hacker
Platform Hackers are the platform level developers who work to deliver on the goals and needs of The Living City from within the Decentraland Open Source Project

City Hackers are the R&D lab of the city, innovating and optimizing on modules which can be used within City projects.

Hackers go through a similar but more intensive pledging process involving more work or stake. Hackers have access to non-public tools. Hackers present developed projects or modules to the LCPC either in pursuit of a stated bounty or unsolicited, and are paid when the LCPC opts to include it within the Living City project.

4 - A Founder -

Steering committee for the project, one vote per founder. Founder status itself may be tokenized and transferred or sold between users.
